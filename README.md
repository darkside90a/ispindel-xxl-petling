CherryPhilip iSpindel in an XXL Petling

Inspired by Thingiverse thing #3666038, a sled design (thing #3271613) and mp-se's great Gravitymon project ( https://github.com/mp-se/gravitymon/ ), I designed some parts to make the iSpindel fit nicely into an XXL Petling.

My intension was to have a hydrometer with more weight, less exposed to krausen during fermentation - maybe.
The total weight is around 178g, quite similar to the "Hydrom" hydrometer.

XXL Petling vs the mostly used XL:

I made up two parts. Front bracket:

And a 40mm support ring:

I made them in ABS, 50% infill, support needed.

The front bracket has an M10 thread in the tip. After experimenting, the weight in the tip now consists of: 
* 1x SS M6x30mm washer with hole increased to 10mm. Weight: 7g
* 1x SS M10 nut. Weight: 10g'ish
* If needed, or for fine adjustment 1 or 2x M5x8mm SS locking screws. Weight: 1g'ish each.

The goal is 25degrees angle @ 20C in water.

Originally, the hole inside the threaded tip was intended to be used for the DS18B20 temp sensor. I made M5 threads in the hole instead, giving space for up to two locking nuts.

The support ring is a snug fit. Slide it from the tip of the PCB, and as long up to the other end as possible. It should pass the battery if it is in place. Slide it on before you put on the front bracket.

As Petling sizes might vary, the front bracket tip has been designed more than long enough. It has to be cut down to correct length:
* Slide on the support ring.
* Slide the front bracket all the way on to the PCB.
* Put the assembly into the Petling.
* The other end of the PCB should be flush with the opening of the Petling. Cut the tip accordingly.

When you are satisfied, you can push the support ring downwards in the Petling (which has a slightly conical shape) to make the PCB well seated. For this, I found the perfect "special tool": a toilet roll core!

The iSpindel was designed with two pins as a "reset button". I found push buttons small enough to be mounted there instead:
